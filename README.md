## About
This project was part of my Cybersecurity coursework that I did in my college in which I had to build Machine Learning algorithms to classify whether a PDF file
in JSON format is Malicious or Benign i.e whether it contains virus or not.
## Data
Data was given to me and it is in JSON format and is populated in the features folder in 2 categories- Malicious & Benign. It contains in total 10000 files equally divided 
for both categories.
## Report
A report on how the data was parsed, challenges faces, EDA insights and different ML models built with their comparison with performance metrics for each.
